Cloth masks bad:
Coth masks resulted in significantly higher infection rates. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% 
and medical masks 44%.

Cloth masks neutral:
There remains a substantial gap in the scientific literature on the 
effectiveness of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza virus 
infection. While there is some experimental evidence that masks
should be able to reduce infectiousness under controlled conditions, 
there is less evidence on whether this translates to effectiveness 
in natural settings. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of
face masks to reduce the risk of infection.

Cloth masks ok:
Surgical mask were 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the 
homemade mask.

Surgical mask good - N95 best:
Surgical masks are up to 2 times as effective with <7um particles but at most
80% effective. N95 for the win.

Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar

Surgical mask good - N95 good:
Surgical mask and N95 performed similarly in the field.

Surgical mask ok:
Influenza virus copy number in aerosol particles exhaled by patients with
mask is significant only with coarse particles 5um but not for fine 
particles wearing an ear-loop surgical mask

sampling air:
transmission distance of SARS-CoV-2 might be 4 m
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article#r3

SARS-CoV-2, in particle sizes >4 µm and 1-4 µm in diameter concentrations in air ranged from 1.84x103 to 3.38x103 RNA copies per m3 air sampled.
Floor has the highest contamination

Environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3.3 × 106 copies/mL (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) and 5.9 × 106 copies/mL (saliva), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.

Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m
protection was increased as distance was lengthened
