Cloth masks bad:
Coth masks resulted in significantly higher infection rates. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% 
and medical masks 44%.

Cloth masks neutral:
There remains a substantial gap in the scientific literature on the 
effectiveness of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza virus 
infection. While there is some experimental evidence that masks
should be able to reduce infectiousness under controlled conditions, 
there is less evidence on whether this translates to effectiveness 
in natural settings. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of
face masks to reduce the risk of infection.

Cloth masks ok:
Surgical mask were 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the 
homemade mask.

Surgical mask good - N95 best:
Surgical masks are up to 2 times as effective with <7um particles but at most
80% effective. N95 for the win.

Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar

Wang et al1 indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by COVID-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing N95 respirators.
N95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles. These must fit tightly to the user’s face.2 Masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit. Surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of >100 μm, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is essentially spherical, albeit slightly pleomorphic, with a diameter of 60–140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter. Thus, surgical masks cannot prevent inhalation of small airborne particles; however,both can protect users from large droplets and sprays.

Surgical mask good - N95 good:
Surgical mask and N95 performed similarly in the field.

Surgical mask ok:
Influenza virus copy number in aerosol particles exhaled by patients with
mask is significant only with coarse particles 5um but not for fine 
particles wearing an ear-loop surgical mask

Our data confirm previous findings that the filtration of submicron-sized airborne particles by a single surgical mask is minimal. 
The median reduction in particle count for a single surgical mask was 2.7. This increased to 5.5 with five surgical masks.
Surgical masks are designed to prevent the wearer from transmitting infection to others, but do provide some protection against respiratory droplet and fomite spread.

SARS-CoV-2, in particle sizes >4 µm and 1-4 µm in diameter concentrations in air ranged from 1.84x103 to 3.38x103 RNA copies per m3 air sampled.

Environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3.3 × 106 copies/mL (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) and 5.9 × 106 copies/mL (saliva), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.
