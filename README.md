Coth masks resulted in significantly higher infection rates. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% 
and medical masks 44%.

Surgical mask and N95 performed similarly in the field.

Surgical masks are up to 2 times as effective with <7um particles but at most
80% effective. N95 for the win.

Surgical mask were 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the 
homemade mask.

Influenza virus copy number in aerosol particles exhaled by patients with
mask is significant only with coarse particles 5um but not for fine 
particles wearing an ear-loop surgical mask

There remains a substantial gap in the scientific literature on the 
effectiveness of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza virus 
infection. While there is some experimental evidence that masks
should be able to reduce infectiousness under controlled conditions, 
there is less evidence on whether this translates to effectiveness 
in natural settings. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of
face masks to reduce the risk of infection.
